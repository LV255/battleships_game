# battleships_game
- Python terminal game.
- Battleships with computer opponent.

## What I learnt
- I couldn't make a game board so I copied that from someone else.
- The game had many errors. To solve this I had two computer players play against each other. When an error happened I fixed it. After fixing many erros, I set the game to play over and over. When the computer players would play through 100 games without errors I was happy it was working. In the future I will do this, instead of a humand player vs. a computer player, I'll just have two computer players playing against each other. It takes the burden off myself when testing and allows for hundreds of games to be played one after another.

## What I am happy with
- The computer opponent AI may be clumsy but it works so I am happy with that.
